# Assorted Machine Learning and Deep Learning School Projects.

Fairly primitive stuff, but they demonstrate an ability to glue two lines of Python together.

- `ml_hw1_preproc.py`: Three classifiers and a barebones preprocessing pipeline
- `ml_hw2_cleaning.py`: Similar to hw1, but with bias metrics
- `ml_hw3_rebalancing.py`: Four rebalancing techniques for unbalanced input data
- `ml_hw4_recommender.py`: A movie recommender, made in collaboration with another student.
- `dl_hw1_gridsearch.py`: Hyperparameter Gridsearch optimization for a simple Multilayer Perceptron Neural Net.
